Run the code as:-
python rc4_2.py

For every message, you will the message, its cipher text, and the message got back after decoding.
Randomness score for 300 messages for (message_len,toggle_size) is calculated.

At the end, you will get a graph of randomness_score vs key_toggle_size.

The graph by my previous run is kept in the folder as graph.png
